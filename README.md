# BrodyCox2524.github.io
My name is Brody Wade Cox and my student e-mail is bwcox1@my.waketech.edu. This is my school GitHub account using my Wake Tech e-mail. I will use it when completing assignments in my online course throughout the semester. This repository was created to hold my assignments throughout the semester. This will allow me to save versions of things I work on throughout my time at Wake Tech. 
# About Me
## Hobbies
Most of my favorite things to do are active. I love being outside and experiencing new things. I enjoy skateboarding, scuba diving, surfing, snowboarding, running, and may more outdoor activities. I love to relax indoors as well. I recently learned embroidery, I grow over 10 species of plants, and I rock climb indoors at my gym. Personally, I dislike being bored and I am always looking for something new to try. 
### Websites I use frequently
I generally use websites for school related projects.  

Here is a website I use frequently for research: [NC Live](www.nclive.org).
I like this website because I can easily access scholarly articles to use as sources for any research paper I'm writing. 

Here is a website I use to edit images for slideshows: [Background Remover](www.remove.bg).
This website is especially useful for removing the background of an image. This way the background of the slide is kept without something like a random white box behind your image. 
## Future Goals
Currently, I am a high school student taking CCP courses at Wake Tech. In the future, I'm hoping to use these credits to get college credit at a four year university. I will have enough credits to graduate in three years. Subsequently, I am planning on going to law school. Overall, I would like to get my Bachelor's degree in finance and eventually go to law school then become a lawyer before ultimately opening my own practice.
