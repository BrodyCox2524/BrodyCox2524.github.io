My name is Brody Wade Cox and my student e-mail is bwcox1@my.waketech.edu
Today I created a new school GitHub account using my Wake Tech e-mail. I will use it when completing assignments in my online course throughout the semester. 
I created a repository in GitHub to hold my assignments throughout the semester. This will allow me to save versions of things I work on during this class.
