            I am a senior at Middle Creek High School. <break>
            Next year, I will be going to the University of North Carolina <break>
            at Chapel Hill. Eventually, I want to be a lawyer specializing <break>
            in financial law. I love school, but also have many hobbies <break>
            such as thrifting, track and field, scuba diving, and many more.
