            I am a senior at Middle Creek High School. <br>
            Next year, I will be going to the University of North Carolina <br>
            at Chapel Hill. Eventually, I want to be a lawyer specializing <br>
            in financial law. I love school, but also have many hobbies <br>
            such as thrifting, track and field, scuba diving, and many more.
