            I am a senior at Middle Creek High School. Next year, 
            I will be going to the University of North Carolina
            at Chapel Hill. Eventually, I want to be a lawyer specializing
            in financial law. I love school, but also have many hobbies
            such as thrifting, track and field, scuba diving, and many more.
